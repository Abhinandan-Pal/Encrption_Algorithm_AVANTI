# Encrption_Algorithm_AVANTI
It is a random number based encrytion algorithm.With this algorithm same string put through the encryption algorithm will generate a ciphertext out of 85^24 possibilities. In other words, a single text can be encrypted to 85^24 ciphertext all of which will decrypt back to the initial Text.
